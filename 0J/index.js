//Modules in JS
/*JavaScript Runtime Environment:
-> A runtime environment is a place our program is executed.
-> In-Case of Javascript it is either Browser or Node-JS environment.

MODULES:
-> Writing all our Server Side JS Code in a single JS file is possible but impractical.
-> If we create modules, break the code into pieces in separate files & use it on the main file is a practical and neat solution.
-> Modules are reusable pieces of code in a file that can be exported and then imported for use in another file.
-> A modular program is one whose components can be separated, used individually, and rcombined to create a complex system.
